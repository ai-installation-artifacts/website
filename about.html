        Artifacts is an interactive installation that invites visitors to submit personal data
        in exchange for a seemingly personalized poem.
      </p>
      <p>
        What begins as a poetic gesture soon becomes a reflection on data, control, and artificial intelligence:
        From a few simple details, not only a poem is generated, but also documents that push
        the data beyond its original intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        These artifacts reveal how personal information can be captured, transformed, and reframed. The
        original control is slipping quietly out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single input gives more than just data. It hands over control. What AI creates from it can’t be
        undone. Or can it?
